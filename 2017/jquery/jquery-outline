What is it?
-----------

A JavaScript library that makes interacting with the DOM (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model#/media/File:DOM-model.svg), handling events,
and making Ajax calls (getting and sending data) easy.

It contains  many useful functions such as .each() which allows you
to loop over a collection of selected HTML elements. Can be used to create, remove, or modify elements.

Important Note
--------------

Everything that jQuery allows you to do can be done using regular JavaScript.

Take a look at the source: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.js

If you are using only one piece of the library, better to write the raw JavaScript instead.

jQuery      $("#element")
JavaScript  var x = document.getElementById("mySelect");

How to Get It
-------------

We need to link to the file.

  http://code.jquery.com/

Either download it, or copy the <script> tag they provide into your HTML file.

Example:

  <script src="jquery-3.2.1.min.js"> (the file is in the root directory)

  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
