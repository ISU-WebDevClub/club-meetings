Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

INTRO

  Goal: Make web applications feel like native mobile applications.
  
  It is not any kind of framework, rather an idea.
  
  The term was created by engineers at Google, they have a good outline on
  how to make a PWA: https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/
  
HISTORY
  
  Static (HTML) -> Dynamic from server (PHP, ASP.NET) -> Client side
  processing (JavaScript)
  
  The current state is what allows PWA to exist.
  
  In the early days of smartphone, native apps outperformed anything that was
  accessed through a mobile web browser.
  
  Now web apps are a viable alternative to native apps.

  Hybrid apps are made with HTML, CSS, JS instead of Java or Swift.
  
PWA

  Modern features such as service workers allow web apps to come even closer
  to the native OS.
  
  What makes a PWA?

    Progressive enhancement: Content first, then add more for more capable
    browsers or devices.
    
    Responsive: The design works on any size screen, mobile or desktop.

    Service workers: Scripting between the app and the network that is used to
    manage HTTP requests. For a PWA, they should respond with a 200 even if
    offline. This is a big advantage of PWA. They work offline (as much as
    possible).

    Feels like an app (gestures, touch on mobile devices).

    Secured over HTTPS.

    Can be found through search engines.

    Can create push notifications and access other device features.

    Can be saved to a phone's home screen.

    Easily shared through a link.

CRITERIA

  Although we listed many features, a PWA does not need to take advantage of
  all of them.

  There are four technical details that must be met for a browser to recognize
  a PWA.

  1. Secured with TLS encryption.
  2. Load when offline. Could be a single page telling the user to get
     internet.
  3. Manifest file in JSON format: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
  4. PNG icon at least 144 by 144.
